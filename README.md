# My portfolio

This is my "**portfolio/website**" and it's currently hosted on my [**Server**](https://nicolanapa.duckdns.org) and on [**Netlify**](https://nicolanapa.netlify.app).<br />
If you're interested to see the new features from the [development](https://github.com/nicolanapa/portfolio/tree/development) branch you can check the
[**development subdomain**](https://development.nicolanapa.duckdns.org/).

## Server's status

If the site doesn't load, the server might be off since it's not always on.<br />
If my Server is off then check the [Netlify option](https://nicolanapa.netlify.app).<br />
If it's taking too long to load the website then the cause might be the DNS i'm using (Duck DNS).

## Server's specs

My server has these specs if you're interested:

-   CPU
    -   i7-4770
-   RAM
    -   16GB DDR3

As you can see it's not really new but I've upgraded it a lot (bought it used cheaply, upgraded CPU, RAM, SSD and bought 2 1TB HDDs)
